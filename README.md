Project Title:
SkillLink – A Platform Connecting Skilled Practitioners to Clients and Government Institutions

Project Summary:
SkillLink is a secure, easy-to-use digital platform designed to connect skilled practitioners, including fashion designers, carpenters, drivers, phone technicians, and others, with individual clients, businesses, and government agencies. The platform addresses the challenges of inaccessibility, lack of trust, and limited digital exposure by providing a structured, searchable, and verified database accessible via mobile and web applications.

Problem Statement:
Clients and organizations often face difficulty locating reliable, verified skilled workers due to the absence of formal directories and trust systems. This leads to time loss, poor service delivery, and underutilization of local talent. Simultaneously, skilled practitioners are often underemployed, depending solely on word-of-mouth for jobs. Government bodies and NGOs also face bottlenecks due to a lack of structured access to verified local talent, delaying interventions and development programs.

Project Goal:
To build a responsive digital platform that streamlines discovery, verification, and engagement between skilled practitioners and clients/institutions, thereby enhancing visibility, access, economic empowerment, and job creation.
